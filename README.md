# Competitive Programming 

> Short Description

Hi, I'm Tobias Rossi Müller and this is my repository of competitive programming codes. If you liked the content consider giving it a star.
I'm just a novice training for ICPC and code interviews, so the content is not as high level as it can be found on the internet, but it's still a good way to keep your workouts more organized. This solutions are from codeforces problems (https://codeforces.com/).
